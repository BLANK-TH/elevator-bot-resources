𝙈𝙄𝙎𝘾𝙃𝙄𝙀𝙁 𝙈𝘼𝙉𝘼𝙂𝙀𝘿 is a Harry Potter roleplay server set in the ( First Wizarding War ) . During your time at Hogwarts, you’ll learn many things, from flying on a broomstick to brewing a potion to stop death. Most importantly, however, is finding out where you stand during the rise of the Dark Lord.

The year is ( 𝟏𝟗𝟕𝟐 ) and Hogwarts is under staunch protection of its head teacher; the school is a safe haven in the chaos of the wizarding world. Well, for the most part. They say Hogwarts is the safest place on earth, but the Dark Lord only gains more power as the days tick by. Loyalties will be put to the test, blood relations straining under the weight of knowing what is easy and what is right. Needless to say, the end of year exams won’t be the only things you have to worry about.

But just remember this . . .

◜ ❛ Help will always be given at Hogwarts
to those who ask for it. ❜◞
