{"1":"`1`. Be respectful!","2":"`2`. Stay away from NSFW subjects because not everyone is comfortable with dirty thoughts.","3":"`3`. We have different channels for a reason, so please stay on topic in whichever channel you're on.","4":"`4`. Personal info is not to be shared (phone #, address, etc). And if you know the person in real life and they explicitly told you not to tell any information (real name, nickname, etc) then DON'T (that means you jAsMIne).","5":"`5`. Please don't discriminate any gender, race, religion, etc.","6":"`6`. You may not promote your own server or anyone else's unless you have permission from the owner (Jasmine).","7":"`7`. Make sure your name is pingable and doesn't contain NSFW content, It has to have at least one character that can be inputted on a standard US-English keyboard. If you don't do so within 1-2 days of joining, your name will be changed into something random by one of the mods. You may or may not be told to change it.","8":"`8`. Do not change your name/profile picture to try and impersonate another user or staff member (especially the latter). Use of the `s!impersonate` command is fine as it's use is logged and there is a `BOT` tag to distinguish it from an actual user.","9":"`9`. Make sure to censor certain sensitive words (such as ||gun||, ||blood||, etc). This is due to certain member(s) of this server being sensitive to certain words. To censor them out, do this `||word here||`. If you say one of these words, the bot will automatically delete your message and ask you to properly spoiler it."}
