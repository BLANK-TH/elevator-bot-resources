<@&733444976461086771>  We are making a Active Member role for the people who are generally more active in the server than other people. This is only attainable through one of the Staff members giving it to you (not buying it, not sending a certain amount of messages, etc). Currently the colour of the role is \#FF00E5 (A bright pink). Of course if you choose to override the colour with a colour from <#686703151738519561> you can. But you can also choose not to use the colour in <#686703151738519561> and use the default active colour (the active colour is supposed to be rare and cannot be gotten from <#686703151738519561> or anything else). Please post a colour hex code (post it by doing `\#<hex code here>`) in <#687043203416719401>  then mention me to give the suggestions. Once we've gotten around 5 colours then it'll be put up to a vote in <#736243251149013043> . If we don't get a single suggestion then I'll choose one myself. The active member roles will start to be given out on August 5th 2020 (at around 14:00 EST). Currently the users that are being added to Active Members are: Pidge, katy, myself (I NEED TO HAVE ALL ROLES!!!!), jasmine (even if it won't show because they're staff), ugly mira (even if it won't show because they're staff).
