**PARTNERING RULES**
```Hello there ! This is the channel that has the requirements of the partnering system. We aren't stiff about the rules but measures are still needed. Please read the following before requesting! ```

**REQS**
```↳ Your server must follow Discord's policy and terms of service
↳ If there are toxic communities in your server, we will not partner
↳ @/everyone cannot be in the description and will be removed
↳ Our server description and link must be posted in your server otherwise we will delete your server description and link```

**Please note these things as well:***
```↳ We do not need to stay in your server & vice versa. We will join to make sure of the requirements and our ads are posted
↳ No promoting your server outside #✧┊partner is allowed. The only server link should be in #✧┊partner. Any other links will be deleted
↳ Expired links will be deleted
↳ Please have at least 15 members active before partnering with us!```
