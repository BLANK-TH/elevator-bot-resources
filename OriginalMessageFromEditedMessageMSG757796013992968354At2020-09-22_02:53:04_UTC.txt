Have you heard of the school privacy horror stories about HonorLock and ProcterU? It's been all over reddit recently. They literally make you install the program and it's esentially malware. They do a scan of your computer (all personal files), ask you to do a 360° scan of your room, look through your registry, allow the teacher to see through your webcam at all times, etc. I hope you people don't have that in your school. Either way, the minute I heard of it, I've been preparing for it. Including having set up an obscured VM (in both windows and linux depending on how confused I want them to be), have 2 other computers nearby if needed (which I don't care about and I can factory reset at any point), a fake 360° scan and webcam feed, and other similar stuff. I know for a fact that people have started petitions against it and some people are considering lawsuits, but none has happened yet. Anyways, thought I'd warn you about this. As with everything on the internet, don't believe everything you here and take stuff with a grain of salt.
