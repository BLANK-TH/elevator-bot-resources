**PM APPS**
```We are now open for partner managers! If you are wondering what that is , it is a role of promoting our server to other servers! You'll be required to read through to the steps and rules before filling out the application. Please continue reading to apply!```

**WHAT ARE PMS?**
```pms get partnerships. it's like a form of advertisement that goes both ways. if a server wants to "partner" with another server, a pm from each server sends each other the description of their server ( #✧┊description  ) and they post each other's description into the partnership channel which here would be #✧┊partner . most servers have requirements or rules for partnering (ours is in #✧┊partnership-rules ) so the person wanting to partner has to make sure their server follows those requirements in order to partner.```

**WHAT ARE THE RULES?**
```⌦ be moderately active 
⌦ be nice while requesting for partnering
⌦ make sure that you understand our rules and the opposite server reqs so we don't get turned down for promotion
⌦ you must be a member here for at least 2 days! 
⌦ make sure there is no @/everyone or @/here in their description
⌦ if you break these rules there will be a warning (we'll only give you 3 chances)```
