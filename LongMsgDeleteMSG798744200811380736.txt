TRIALS OF TEYVAT is a genshin impact inspired rp, where characters are free to roam throughout the nations. the extent of their elemental abilities may be put to the test as they wander into various domains — or, perhaps, they are content to live out their days in a quiet village. whatever their dream, teyvat is nothing if not plentiful in its opportunities.

even so, tensions remain high as the fatui exert their influence throughout their land. nothing is perfect, not even in teyvat. 

between dying archons and whispers of a rebellion, it seems that the inhabitants of all seven nations truly have their work cut out for them.
