Shingeki no Kyojin: Soulmates.



Welcome. To the World of Attack on Titan. Man eating monsters surround the entirety of the walls, leading to constant despair and death. But there's people who stand up to this... The Regiments. The Military Police, those who are corrupt and unforgiving. The Garrison, ones who watch over the walls. And the Scout Regiment. Those who go out and fight for the greater good. 

But it's not all doom and gloom. There is cheerfulness. That comes in the form of Soulmates. People who you are bound to by some invisible force. The area around you isn't the worst when you know someone is hunting for you. Remain strong out there soldier, it'll keep you alive.
