1. DDoS means Distributed Denial of Service Attacl. Basically it means to use a large botnet or group of servers/computers in order to overload a website's servers with the number of requests it's getting. You cannot DDoS an account, it's literally impossible, just a mumbo jumbo of words. Even if it were to be possible, the sheer amount of resources and ability required to do a DDoS attack is rare. The few people who do know how to do that are either working as a white hat employee or are spending their time in dark web forums, not discord. 2. They have no way of obtaining the groups of a user account without logging in to that account legitimately (using a username, password, and a 2FA code if needed) or a database leak from discord. Both of those methods cannot be obtained through friending a user. 3. The only way for them to get your IP address is to have you connect to a server (most commonly done by sending an IP grabbing redirect link). Meaning that as long as you don't download, or click any link/file the user sends, you're okay. 4. Even if they do get your IP address, there's literally not much they can do with it. The most they can find out is the approximate location of your ISPs server, which doesn't do much for them. An IP address is the public indentifier of a computer that is linked to a server from your ISP, it doesn't actually do much. Think of an IP address like it's a username but for the entire internet. You can change your IP anyways as well.
