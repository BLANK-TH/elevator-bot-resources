<@&733444976461086771> The joining/leaving system has been updated/improved. <@!699677108607123548> will be the one welcoming people, upon joining they will be assigned the <@&737092006349635706> role. They will not be able to see any channels except <#686700028399452181> <#685932859097350160> and <#737093236803239977> . They can go to <#737093236803239977> then enter `s!verify` and solve the captcha to gain access to the rest of the server. You might be wondering `how might this affect me` and so on. To answer that question, if you see a new welcome message in <#685932859097350160> and you try and find them or ping them to welcome them, you won't be able to see the person until they verify because they can't see the channel you are in right now. If you choose to join and re-join, you will need to solve the captcha again. If you want to see the new person/unverified person, you can go to <#686700028399452181> or <#685932859097350160> then look at the member list, you will see them listed under <@&737092006349635706> , you won't be able to see them anywhere else until they verify themselves.
